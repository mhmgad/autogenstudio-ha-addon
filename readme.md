# Autogenstudio as an Add-on

## About

This add-on runs autogenstudio as a service.


## Installation


1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to <kbd>Settings</kbd> -> <kbd>Add-ons</kbd> -> <kbd>Add-on Store (Bottom Right)</kbd>.

2. Click the 3-dots menu at upper right <kbd>...</kbd> > <kbd>Repositories</kbd> and add this repository's URL: [https://github.com/mhmgad/autogenstudio-ha-addon](https://github.com/mhmgad/autogenstudio-ha-addon)


3. Reload the page , scroll to the bottom to find the new repository, and click the new add-on named "Home Assistant Google Drive Backup"
   
   
   
   Note: Home Assistant loads the repository in the background and the new item won't always show up automatically.  You might need to wait a few seconds and then "hard refesh" the page for it to show up.  On most browser the keyboard shortcut for this is CTRL+F5. If it still doesn't show up, clear your browser's cache and it should then.
4. Click <kbd>Install</kbd> and give it a few minutes to finish downloading.

5. Click <kbd>Start</kbd>, give it a few seconds to spin up, and then click the `Open Web UI` button that appears.

After installation, the integration will be available to configure through the Home Assistant UI under Settings > Devices & Services.
